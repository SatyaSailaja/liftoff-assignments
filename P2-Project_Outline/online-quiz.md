### What you'll have to learn
This is the very first time building an application all by myself in Spring boot,Spring MVC, CRUD operations  with a good look and feel. I will actually have to learn a lot to accomplish this application. It would be very fun to learn how to integrate and make it work as how we do it in the real time Quiz scenario. Making use of java Script for validations, responsive HTML/CSS for the first time. Creating a timer of 60 sec using public API's , want to make use of sessions and cookies in this project. I think other things will be discovered along the way.
